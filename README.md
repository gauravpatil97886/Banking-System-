# Banking-System

------------------------

- The PHP-based Bank Management System project was created. This is a straightforward project that is very simple to use. Speaking of the system, it has all the necessary features, such as the ability to Create Account, Add Amount, Delete Account, Update Data, Transfer Money, etc. A person must include their first and last names, gender, address, and contact information while adding their account. 

-If the user so chooses, he or she may also edit the bank account. The system displays a list view of the bank information. Additionally, the user may erase any bank account with ease.

- The easiest way to manage bank information is provided by this project's bank management system. In a nutshell, CRUD is the core focus of these projects. This small project uses an external database connection file to save user data indefinitely. You need to have installed XAMPP on your computer in order to run the project.
